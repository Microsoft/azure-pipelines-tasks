## **Important Notice**
The "Azure App Service Deployment: Classic" task has been **deprecated and will be removed soon**. To update Azure App Services using Web Deploy / Kudu REST APIs, please use the [**Azure App Service Deployment: ARM** task](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/AzureRmWebAppDeployment). 
We recommend you to migrate your Build or Release definitions to replace the deprecating task with the 'Azure App Service Deployment: ARM' task.
